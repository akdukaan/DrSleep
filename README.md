# DrSleep
A fair sleeping solution

## What is DrSleep?
DrSleep is similar to singleplayer sleep where one player in bed will skip the night. However, the difference is that, with DrChat, if any player wants it to stay night, sleeping won't skip the night. Players can use the /preventsleep command to stop players from sleeping through the night.

## What's wrong with vanilla sleep?
On survival multiplayer servers, all players have to be sleeping in a bed to skip the night. This rarely happens on larger servers due to a lack of coordination. As a result, the normal day/night cycle continues even if the players on the server want to skip the night. This can lead to frustration for many players who want to skip the night.

## What's wrong with other sleeping plugins?
Some plugins attempt to resolve this problem by having players vote each night to skip the night. However, players in AFK can't vote. These plugins also spam the server chat and can frustrate many players who want to play the game uninterrupted. Other plugins make it so that just any one player needs to be in bed to skip the night. This is unfair to any players who want night as they will never get that.
